# Library App with SAP CAP ðŸ“š

This application is built using SAP Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP) and serves as a learning tool to understand key concepts in CAP development. It provides a structured approach to managing Authors and Books, which are the core entities in this system.

### Purpose

- Core Data Services (CDS):
  - Learn to declaratively define service definitions, data models, queries, and expressions using CDS.
  - Explore how CDS transforms these definitions into various target languages for use within the application.

### Features
