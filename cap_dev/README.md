# Hana Cloud FullStack Application with SAP CAP - Fiori üåê

Welcome to the **Hana Cloud FullStack Application with SAP CAP - Fiori** project. This is a full-stack application where I practiced integrating SAP CAP for backend services with Hana Cloud for database management and a modern UI using SAP Fiori. 

The application is very simple, it has a header artifact and an item artifact. When you run all the necessary commands, it will show you new folders and files, don't forget to establish a connection with your BTP
