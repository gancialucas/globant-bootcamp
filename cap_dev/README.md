# Hana Cloud FullStack Application with SAP CAP - Fiori üåê

Welcome to the **Hana Cloud FullStack Application with SAP CAP - Fiori** project. This is a full-stack application where I practiced integrating SAP CAP for backend services with Hana Cloud for database management and a modern UI using SAP Fiori. The application is very simple, it has a Header artifact and an Item artifact.
